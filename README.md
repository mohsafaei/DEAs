## [In silico actuation performance investigation of dielectric elastomers with TPMS geometries](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euromechsol.2024.105540)


Part of the code for creating TPMS structures was developed by Fayyaz Nosouhi (dehnavifn@gmail.com) and Saeed Khaleghi (saeedkhaleghi123@gmail.com).
The remaining parts of the code, including the definition of DEA composites and their implementation in ABAQUS, were developed by Mohammad Ali Safaei (mohammadsf1998@gmail.com). 
This Python script requires the use of a UEL subroutine, which implements the constitutive equations for a DEA element. In this regard, the UEL subroutine developed by Ehsan Hajiesmaili was utilized. 
The UEL file and its explanation are available in the following research article: https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article/129/15/151102/1025587/Dielectric-elastomer-actuators
